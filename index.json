In this paper, we undertake a horizontal study on a critical TCP hijacking attack affecting Linux servers, which was reported in November 2020 (CVE-2020-36516). This attack has the potential to compromise over 20\\% of popular websites on the Internet. Our study particularly focuses on determining the extent to which the developed stack patches, designed to address this vulnerability, have been effectively deployed in the real world and whether they have successfully mitigated the identified attack. In our horizontal study, we thoroughly examine the current status of the vulnerability, covering upstream and downstream components of the Linux ecosystem. This study encompasses 12 mainstream Linux distributions, 296 images from 7 leading cloud vendors, 2.92 million IPs from 301 network segments belonging to 6 major CDN vendors, as well as the top 1 million websites from 3 datasets. Our large-scale measurement study has resulted in significant discoveries. Our study unveils a notable disparity in the patching of the vulnerability in the Linux ecosystem, spanning various ISPs and vendors, which leaves the vulnerability open to potential exploitation and poses a serious threat to the Internet.","tags":[],"title":"A Horizontal Study on the Mixed IPID Assignment Vulnerability in the Linux Ecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxiang Yang","Xuewei Feng","Qi Li","Kun Sun","Ziqiang Wang","Ke Xu"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1709424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709424000,"objectID":"6ca2829b726c3c4cd788f897a291ba1d","permalink":"https://yyxroy.github.io/publication/ndss24_tcp_hijacking/","publishdate":"2023-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ndss24_tcp_hijacking/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we uncover a new side-channel vulnerability in the widely-used NAT port preservation strategy and an insufficient reverse path verification strategy of Wi-Fi routers, which allows an off-path attacker to infer if there is one victim client in the same network communicating with another host on the Internet using TCP. After detecting the presence of TCP connections between the victim client and the server, the attacker can evict the original NAT mapping and reconstruct a new mapping at the router by sending fake TCP packets due to the routers’ vulnerability of disabling TCP window tracking strategy, which has been faithfully implemented in most of the routers for years. In this way, the attacker can intercept TCP packets from the server and obtain the current sequence and acknowledgment numbers, which in turn allows the attacker to forcibly close the connection, poison the traffic in plain text, or reroute the server’s incoming packets to the attacker.\n\nWe test 67 widely used routers from 30 vendors and discover that 52 of them are affected by this attack. Also, we conduct an extensive measurement study on 93 real-world Wi-Fi networks. The experimental results show that 75 of these evaluated Wi-Fi networks (81%) are fully vulnerable to our attack. Our case study shows that it takes about 17.5, 19.4, and 54.5 seconds on average to terminate an SSH connection, download private files from FTP servers, and inject fake HTTP response packets with success rates of 87.4%, 82.6%, and 76.1%.

Despite the various security mechanisms (e.g., WEP and WPA2/WPA3) implemented to safeguard Wi-Fi networks, our study reveals that an off path attacker can still extract sufficient information from the frame size side channel to hijack the victim's TCP connection. Our side channel attack is based on two significant findings ':' (i) response packets (e.g., ACK and RST) generated by TCP receivers vary in size, and (ii) the encrypted frames containing these response packets have consistent and distinguishable sizes. By observing the size of the victim's encrypted frames, the attacker can detect and hijack the victim's TCP connections. We validate the effectiveness of this side channel attack through two case studies, i.e., SSH DoS and web traffic manipulation. Precisely, our attack can terminate the victim's SSH session in 19 seconds and inject malicious data into the victim's web traffic within 28 seconds. Furthermore, we conduct extensive measurements to evaluate the impact of our attack on real-world Wi-Fi networks. We test 30 popular wireless routers from 9 well-known vendors, and none of these routers can protect victims from our attack. Besides, we implement our attack in 80 real-world Wi-Fi networks and successfully hijack the victim's TCP connections in 75 (93.75%) evaluated Wi-Fi networks. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to the Wi-Fi Alliance and proposed several mitigation strategies to address this issue.","tags":[],"title":"Off-Path TCP Hijacking in Wi-Fi Networks: A Packet-Size Side Channel Attack","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1694696400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694696400,"objectID":"647c1e48bdb43b55287bb3356da1e68f","permalink":"https://yyxroy.github.io/talk/open-week-of-cs-student-achievements/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/open-week-of-cs-student-achievements/","section":"event","summary":"In the 2023 Open Week of CS Student Achievements, I presented our paper \"Exploiting Sequence Number Leakage - TCP Hijacking in NAT-Enabled Wi-Fi Networks\"","tags":[],"title":"Open Week of CS Student Achievements","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xuewei Feng","Qi Li","Kun Sun","Yuxiang Yang","Ke Xu"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1690588800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690588800,"objectID":"01594a277f7cce8cc62c101fa09ff578","permalink":"https://yyxroy.github.io/publication/turc23_wifi_hijacking/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/turc23_wifi_hijacking/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

In traditional Evil Twins attacks, attackers may deploy a bogus wireless access point (AP) to hijack the victim supplicants’ traffic (e.g., stealing credentials). In this paper, we uncover a new MITM attack that can evade the security mechanisms in Wi-Fi networks by spoofing the legitimate AP to send a forged ICMP redirect message to a victim supplicant and thus allow attackers to stealthily hijack the traffic from the victim supplicant without deploying any bogus AP. The core idea is to misuse the vulnerability of cross-layer interactions between WPAs and ICMP protocols, totally evading the link layer security mechanisms enforced by WPAs. We resolve two requirements to successfully launch our attack. First, when the attacker spoofs the legitimate AP to craft an ICMP redirect message, the legitimate AP cannot recognize and filter out those forged ICMP redirect messages. We uncover a new vulnerability (CVE-2022-25667) of the Network Processing Units (NPUs) in AP routers that restrict the AP routers from blocking fake ICMP error messages passing through the router. We test 55 popular wireless routers from 10 well-known AP vendors, and none of these routers can block the forged ICMP redirect messages due to this vulnerability. Second, we develop a new method to ensure the forged ICMP redirect message can evade the legitimacy check of the victim supplicant and then poison its routing table. We conduct an extensive measurement study on 122 real-world Wi-Fi networks, covering all prevalent Wi-Fi security modes. The experimental results show that 109 out of the 122 (89%) evaluated Wi-Fi networks are vulnerable to our attack. Besides notifying the vulnerability to the NPU manufacturers and the AP vendors, we develop two countermeasures to throttle the identified attack.","tags":[],"title":"Man-in-the-Middle Attacks without Rogue AP: When WPAs Meet ICMP Redirects","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1684846800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684846800,"objectID":"15b393b1d4a9b05263f1d783fa5cb324","permalink":"https://yyxroy.github.io/talk/sp-2023/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/sp-2023/","section":"event","summary":"In the 2023 44th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, I presented our paper \"Man-in-the-Middle Attacks without Rogue AP - When WPAs Meet ICMP Redirects\"","tags":[],"title":"S\u0026P 2023","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xuewei Feng","Ke Xu","Qi Li","Yuxiang Yang","Min Zhu","Songtao Fu"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1680048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680048000,"objectID":"dfb4361f5283698fea79d253a56738fb","permalink":"https://yyxroy.github.io/publication/jos23_chain_verification/","publishdate":"2023-03-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jos23_chain_verification/","section":"publication","summary":"The transport layer is a key component in network protocol stack, which is responsible for providing end-to-end services for applications between different end hosts on the Internet. Existing transport layer protocols such as TCP provide users with some basic protections, e.g., error controls and acknowledgements, which ensures the consistency of user datagram to a certain extent. However, these basic protections are not adequate to defend various attacks on the Internet. For example, the sequence number of TCP segments is easy to be guessed and inferred, and the calculation of the datagram’s checksum depends on the vulnerable one's complement sum. As a result, the existing transport layer security mechanisms cannot guarantee the integrity and security of the datagram transferred on the Internet, which allows a remote attacker to craft a fake datagram and inject it into the target network stream, thus poisoning the target network stream. The attack against the transport layer occurs at the basic layers of the network protocol stack, which can bypass the security mechanisms enforced at the upper application layer (e.g., user name and password) and thus cause serious damages to the network infrastructure. In this paper, after investigating various prior attacks over network protocols and the related security vulnerabilities, we propose a security mechanism LightCTL based on the lightweight chain verification, which can be deployed at the transport layer to guarantee the integrity of the datagram transferred on the Internet. Based on the hash verification, LightCTL enables both peers of a TCP connection to create a verifiable consensus on transport layer datagrams, so as to prevent attackers from stealing and forging sensitive information. As a result, LightCTL can successfully foil various attacks against network protocol stack, including TCP connection reset attacks based on sequence number inferring, TCP hijacking attacks, SYN flooding attacks, Man-in-The-Middle attacks, replay attacks. Besides, LightCTL does not need to modify the protocol stack of intermediate network devices such as routers. It only needs to modify the checksum and the related parts of the end hosts’ protocol stack. Therefore, LightCTL is easy to be deployed in the real world and significantly improves the security of networks.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Method for Enhancing Network Security of the Transport Layer by Leveraging the Lightweight Chain Verification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxiang Yang","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
